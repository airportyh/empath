TODO
====

* rename globals to standalone.
* we need to detect modules that won't work standalone.
* we need to maybe execute the dependencies along with the files too if we want everything to work(ember.js)
* get it working with component
* get it working with node modules
* get dependencies info from bower.json, component.json and package.json as well
* If still can't find main, walk directory to find a .js file with same basename as directory.
